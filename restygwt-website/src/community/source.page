    The *#{project_name}* project stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.
    If you are new to Git you might like to try the 
    [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the 
    [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

    The Git repository is here:

    * **#{git_user_url}**

    You can [browse the repository online](#{github_page}) if you prefer.

  :&markdown

    You must first install a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/download). Then 
    you clone the repository using the Git URL:

          git clone #{git_user_url}
        cd #{project_id}

    Now you probably want to try [build the #{project_name} code](building.html)

    Once you have checked out the code try following 

    * [instructions to build #{project_name}](building.html) 
    * read the [documentation](../documentation/index.html)
    * browse the [developer links and maven reports](developers.html)
